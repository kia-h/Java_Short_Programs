# Java---Short-Programs
these are some short prgramming problems i did over years

MinMax.java: a class called MinMax that has two short recursive methods that find 
             the minimum and maximum values in a LinkedList ADT of Integer values without using any loops.

Reverse.java: it reverse a given String in 2 ways, using StringBuilder and 
              the other one is just traversing it and save it in reverse

StackQueue: this is my attempt to implement Stack and Queue ADT using  ArrayList
